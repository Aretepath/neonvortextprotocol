<h2>Scene One: Grounding Out</h2>
<p>
Radio hums softly in the background.

RADIO HOST (V.O.):
"It’s 4AM in Seattle. Whether you’re clocking off or gearing up — stay safe out there, dear listener. Here’s a synthwave track climbing the charts: When the Beat Fades Out. Enjoy."

The music’s low and moody — the kind that slips into shadows and lingers. I press my foot down on the Electro Viper 6T. Its wheels light up neon purple, casting ripples through puddles as I cruise under the skyline’s glow.

[INCOMING CALL: MIA]
The hub rings, her name pulsing on the dash.

MIA (crackling):
“Hunter? You there? Pick up!”

I tap the interface.
“Yeah, I’m here. What are you doing up? It’s 4AM.”

MIA:
“I could ask you the same thing. You promised no more late-night drives. And — wait — are you driving?”

“Yeah, but relax. I’m clean. Not a drop tonight.” I glance at the breathalyzer strip on the dash. “Why are you calling me on this line?”

Then, the voice. Calm. Analytical. Always on cue.

ECHO (internal):
“Hunter, Mia cares. Patience is key.”

“Echo, not now,” I mutter, jaw tight. “She knows better than to use this number.”

MIA:
“Let me cut to it. A kid down on 7th Street got jumped. Laptop stolen. Claims it held sensitive government data. He works for a cloud firm under contract.”

“I’m not contracting anymore.”

MIA:
“I know. But this smells wrong. Closed system. Air-gapped. They didn’t want the machine — they wanted what was on it.”

ECHO:
“She’s right. That kind of op isn’t random.”

I sigh. Grip the wheel tighter.
“Send the address. And go get some sleep, Mia.”

MIA (softly):
“Just... be careful, Hunter. This one feels wrong.”

“You call me at 4AM, drop a job on me, and now you’re worried? I’m hanging up.”

The call ends in a sharp tone. The synth track on the radio fades into a thrum of static as I cross into 7th Street.

ECHO (quietly):
“Strange, isn’t it — that Mia doesn’t call you Dad.”

I stare ahead at the glowing road.
“Yeah... I haven’t earned it.”

PING — address received.

Ryder Mansfield. Male. 21. University of Seattle.
Echo scrolls through the metadata.

ECHO:
“Didn’t Mia go there?”

“Yeah.”
I exhale slowly.
“She left that part out.”

Figures.

The car glides forward, cutting through the neon mist, toward whatever waits on 7th.
